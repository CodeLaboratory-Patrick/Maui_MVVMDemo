# MVVM Pattern in .NET MAUI

## What is the MVVM Pattern?
**MVVM** stands for **Model-View-ViewModel**. It is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering, particularly in applications built using frameworks like **.NET MAUI**, **WPF**, and **Xamarin**. The MVVM pattern helps in separating the user interface from the business logic, promoting code maintainability, reusability, and testability. This separation allows developers to work independently on the UI (View) and logic (Model and ViewModel), which is especially useful in larger applications.

The **MVVM pattern** consists of three main components:
- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View**: Represents the user interface (UI), which displays the data and interacts with the user.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the **View** and the **Model**. It contains the presentation logic and handles data binding to keep the UI in sync with the data.

## Key Features of MVVM
- **Data Binding**: The **ViewModel** is bound to the **View** to ensure that the UI is automatically updated when the data changes.
- **Commanding**: Commands are used in the **ViewModel** to handle user interactions from the **View** without directly manipulating the **View** itself.
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVVM separates the UI (View) from the application logic, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.
- **Testability**: The **ViewModel** and **Model** can be unit tested without requiring a user interface.

## Overview of MVVM Components
| Component   | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Example                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Model**   | Represents the data, state, and business rules. Contains pure data objects and logic related to data access.                                                  | `User` class with properties like `Name` and `Age`. |
| **View**    | Represents the user interface that displays the data and receives user input. It is defined in **XAML** and typically bound to properties in the ViewModel.   | **XAML** page (e.g., `MainPage.xaml`). |
| **ViewModel** | Acts as an intermediary between the **Model** and the **View**. It exposes data through **properties** and handles commands that the **View** can execute. | `MainViewModel` class that contains properties and commands. |

## Example of MVVM in .NET MAUI

### 1. Model
The **Model** is a simple class that represents the data structure.
```csharp
public class User
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. ViewModel
The **ViewModel** contains properties and commands that the **View** can bind to. It also implements the **INotifyPropertyChanged** interface to notify the UI when data changes.
```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Windows.Input;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

public class MainViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private string userName;
    public string UserName
    {
        get => userName;
        set
        {
            if (userName != value)
            {
                userName = value;
                OnPropertyChanged();
            }
        }
    }

    public ICommand SubmitCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        SubmitCommand = new Command(OnSubmit);
    }

    private void OnSubmit()
    {
        // Logic when submit is pressed.
    }

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
    {
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
}
```
- **UserName**: A property that is bound to the UI element in the View, with `OnPropertyChanged()` called whenever the property changes to update the UI.
- **SubmitCommand**: A command that handles user interaction (e.g., button click).
- **INotifyPropertyChanged**: Implemented to notify the View whenever properties change.

### 3. View (XAML)
The **View** is defined in **XAML** and binds to properties in the **ViewModel**.
```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="MauiApp.MainPage">
    <ContentPage.BindingContext>
        <local:MainViewModel />
    </ContentPage.BindingContext>

    <StackLayout Padding="20">
        <Entry Text="{Binding UserName}" Placeholder="Enter your name" />
        <Button Text="Submit" Command="{Binding SubmitCommand}" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```
- **BindingContext**: Sets the binding context of the page to the `MainViewModel`.
- **Entry**: Binds its `Text` property to the `UserName` property in the **ViewModel**, allowing two-way data binding.
- **Button**: Binds its `Command` property to `SubmitCommand` to handle user interaction.

## When to Use MVVM
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVVM is useful when you want to keep the UI code and logic separate. This separation makes the application easier to maintain and extend.
- **Data Binding**: When your application requires frequent updates between the UI and the underlying data, MVVM allows for efficient data binding that keeps everything in sync.
- **Testable Code**: If you need to write unit tests for your application, MVVM provides testable classes in the form of **Models** and **ViewModels**, since they do not depend on the actual UI.
- **Reusability**: The ViewModel can be reused across different Views, making the codebase more modular and reusable.

For example, in an application that requires input forms, displaying data lists, or other interactions that involve data processing, **MVVM** can simplify both development and testing. It keeps user interaction code away from data management logic, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable structure.

## Summary
- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern that separates data, UI, and logic to ensure maintainability, reusability, and testability.
- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View**: Represents the UI elements and how data is displayed to users.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the View and Model, exposing properties and commands for data binding.
- **Use Cases**: MVVM is suitable for applications where separation of logic from UI is crucial, data needs to be frequently updated in the UI, or for reusable and testable components.

# CollectionView SelectionMode in .NET MAUI

## What is `<CollectionView SelectionMode>` in .NET MAUI?
In .NET MAUI, **CollectionView** is a powerful control used to display a collection of data in a flexible and customizable way. The **SelectionMode** property in **CollectionView** determines how items in the collection can be selected by the user. This property is crucial for handling user interactions when selecting one or more items from a list of data.

### SelectionMode Options
The **SelectionMode** property has the following options:

| SelectionMode    | Description                                                                                     | Use Case                                        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **None**         | No selection is allowed. The items are displayed, but users cannot select them.                | Display-only lists with no need for selection.  |
| **Single**       | Only a single item can be selected at a time. Selecting a new item will deselect the previous.  | Use when only one item should be selectable, such as a settings list. |
| **Multiple**     | Multiple items can be selected at the same time.                                                | Use for scenarios where multiple selections are needed, like selecting multiple items for a bulk action. |

### Example of CollectionView with SelectionMode
Below is an example of a **CollectionView** with different **SelectionMode** settings.

#### 1. Single Selection Example
In this example, only one item can be selected at a time. If the user selects a new item, any previously selected item will be deselected.

```xml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Items}" SelectionMode="Single">
    <CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackLayout Padding="10">
                <Label Text="{Binding Name}" FontSize="Large" />
            </StackLayout>
        </DataTemplate>
    </CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
</CollectionView>
```
- **SelectionMode="Single"**: This setting means only one item in the **CollectionView** can be selected at any given time.
- This is useful when the user needs to pick one item from a list, such as choosing a category.

#### 2. Multiple Selection Example
In this example, the user can select multiple items.

```xml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Items}" SelectionMode="Multiple">
    <CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackLayout Padding="10">
                <Label Text="{Binding Name}" FontSize="Large" />
            </StackLayout>
        </DataTemplate>
    </CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
</CollectionView>
```
- **SelectionMode="Multiple"**: This allows the user to select multiple items simultaneously.
- This setting is helpful in situations like selecting multiple files for deletion or tagging items.

#### 3. No Selection Example
In this example, items in the **CollectionView** are displayed without allowing the user to select them.

```xml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Items}" SelectionMode="None">
    <CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackLayout Padding="10">
                <Label Text="{Binding Name}" FontSize="Large" />
            </StackLayout>
        </DataTemplate>
    </CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
</CollectionView>
```
- **SelectionMode="None"**: Users cannot select any items.
- This is useful when the data is only meant to be viewed without any interactive selection, such as displaying read-only information.

## When to Use Each SelectionMode
### 1. **None**
- **Use Case**: When you want to display data without the need for user interaction. For example, showing a list of read-only items like news headlines or a gallery where selection is not relevant.

### 2. **Single**
- **Use Case**: When the user must choose only one option from a list. Examples include selecting a preferred shipping option or choosing a contact from a list.
- **Advantages**: Limits user selection to one, ensuring only one action is applicable at any time.

### 3. **Multiple**
- **Use Case**: When you need to allow the user to select multiple items. Examples include selecting multiple photos to upload or items to delete.
- **Advantages**: Provides flexibility for users to interact with multiple items simultaneously, which is useful in bulk actions.

## Summary of SelectionMode Options
| SelectionMode    | Description                          | Common Use Cases                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **None**         | No selection allowed                 | Display-only lists                         |
| **Single**       | One item can be selected             | Settings lists, option pickers             |
| **Multiple**     | Multiple items can be selected       | Bulk actions, multi-item operations        |

## Practical Scenario
Consider an application where you display a list of documents. Using **Single** selection would make sense if the user needs to view or edit a specific document. However, if you allow the user to delete multiple documents at once, **Multiple** selection would be more suitable. If you simply want to show a read-only list of available documents without allowing selection, then **None** would be appropriate.

# IValueConverter in .NET MAUI

## What is IValueConverter in .NET MAUI?
**IValueConverter** is an interface in **.NET MAUI** that allows you to create custom logic to convert data between the **ViewModel** and the **View**. It is primarily used for **data binding** scenarios, enabling you to transform data in a format that is suitable for display in the user interface.

The **IValueConverter** interface has two primary methods:
- **Convert**: Transforms data from the source (e.g., the ViewModel) to the target (e.g., the View). This is used when you need to display data in the UI in a different format than how it is stored.
- **ConvertBack**: Transforms data from the target (e.g., the View) back to the source (e.g., the ViewModel). This method is optional and used mainly in two-way data binding scenarios.

### Key Features of IValueConverter
- **Data Transformation**: Converts data from one type to another, making it suitable for display.
- **Two-Way Binding**: Allows data conversion in both directions, depending on the application's requirements.
- **Custom Conversion Logic**: Developers can create custom conversion logic, such as formatting numbers, changing colors, or transforming boolean values.
- **Reusable**: Converters are reusable across different views, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Example of IValueConverter in .NET MAUI
Below is an example of how to implement **IValueConverter** to convert a boolean value into a color for display in the UI.

### 1. Implementing the IValueConverter Interface
Create a converter class by implementing the **IValueConverter** interface:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;

public class BooleanToColorConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        if (value is bool boolValue)
        {
            return boolValue ? Colors.Green : Colors.Red;
        }
        return Colors.Transparent;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
- **Convert Method**: The `Convert` method takes a boolean value and returns **Green** if `true` or **Red** if `false`. This method is used to format the data before it is displayed in the UI.
- **ConvertBack Method**: The `ConvertBack` method is not implemented here, as it is not needed in this example. In scenarios where you need two-way binding, you can implement this method to convert data from the UI back to the ViewModel.

### 2. Using the Converter in XAML
To use the converter in **XAML**, you first need to define it as a resource and then bind it to a property:

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:YourNamespace"
             x:Class="MauiApp.MainPage">
    <ContentPage.Resources>
        <ResourceDictionary>
            <local:BooleanToColorConverter x:Key="BoolToColorConverter" />
        </ResourceDictionary>
    </ContentPage.Resources>

    <StackLayout Padding="20">
        <Label Text="Status"
               TextColor="{Binding IsAvailable, Converter={StaticResource BoolToColorConverter}}"
               FontSize="Large" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```
- **ResourceDictionary**: Defines the `BooleanToColorConverter` as a resource that can be reused throughout the **ContentPage**.
- **Converter**: The **Label** binds its `TextColor` property to a boolean property (`IsAvailable`) in the **ViewModel** and uses the `BoolToColorConverter` to determine the color.

### Explanation of Components
- **Convert Method**: Converts the source value (`IsAvailable`) into a target value (`TextColor`) suitable for display.
- **Converter in XAML**: Allows developers to easily apply custom formatting rules directly in the XAML without needing to write code-behind logic.

## When to Use IValueConverter
### 1. **Formatting Data for Display**
- **Use Case**: When data in the **ViewModel** needs to be formatted before being displayed in the **View**. For example, converting a **DateTime** object to a formatted date string or transforming a numeric value to a currency format.
- **Example**: Displaying a user's balance in currency format by converting a `double` value to a formatted string like `"$1,000.00"`.

### 2. **Conditional Formatting**
- **Use Case**: When the visual representation of data depends on a condition. For example, changing the color of a **Label** based on whether a boolean value is `true` or `false`.
- **Example**: Using **BooleanToColorConverter** to change the color of a **Label** to indicate status (e.g., `Green` for available and `Red` for unavailable).

### 3. **Data Transformation**
- **Use Case**: When a specific transformation is required for data binding, such as converting a `bool` to `string` ("Yes" or "No") or converting numbers into a different format.
- **Example**: Displaying `"Yes"` or `"No"` based on a boolean property value.

## Summary of IValueConverter Use Cases
| Scenario                   | Description                                      | Example                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Formatting Data**        | Converts data for display in a specific format   | Convert `DateTime` to `"MM/dd/yyyy"` format  |
| **Conditional Formatting** | Changes UI elements based on conditions          | Convert `bool` to color (`Green`/`Red`)      |
| **Data Transformation**    | Transforms data type to a different presentation | Convert `bool` to `"Yes"` or `"No"`          |

## Practical Scenario
Consider a scenario where you have a list of products in your application, and each product has an **availability status** (`true` or `false`). You want to display the product's status as a **Label** with a background color indicating availability (green for available, red for unavailable). By using an **IValueConverter**, you can bind the boolean property to the `BackgroundColor` of the **Label** and easily achieve this effect without needing additional code behind, simplifying the UI logic.

## Understanding the Code.

![Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 10 48 15â€¯AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bec5c14-b6c9-4905-9598-49e6ffed4d39)

The provided code represents a class named **BoolConverter** that implements the **IValueConverter** interface. In .NET MAUI, **IValueConverter** is used to convert data from one type to another for display in the user interface. This class allows you to add custom conversion logic between the **ViewModel** and the **View** during data binding.

## Breakdown of the Code

### 1. Class Declaration
```csharp
public class BoolConverter : IValueConverter
```
- **`public class BoolConverter`**: This declares a public class named **BoolConverter**.
- **`: IValueConverter`**: The **BoolConverter** class implements the **IValueConverter** interface. This means that the class must provide definitions for the methods defined by **IValueConverter**: **Convert** and **ConvertBack**.

### 2. Convert Method
```csharp
public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```
- **`public object Convert`**: This is the implementation of the **Convert** method required by the **IValueConverter** interface.
- **Parameters**:
  - **`object value`**: The value being passed from the data source (e.g., from the ViewModel to the View).
  - **`Type targetType`**: The type of the target property, meaning the data type of the property that this value is bound to in the UI.
  - **`object parameter`**: An optional parameter that may be used to influence the conversion logic.
  - **`CultureInfo culture`**: Provides culture-specific information for the conversion (e.g., date format, currency format).
- **`throw new NotImplementedException();`**: This line of code throws a **NotImplementedException**, indicating that the method hasn't been implemented yet. It serves as a placeholder, telling the developer that they need to provide logic to convert the incoming value to the appropriate type for the target.
- **Purpose of Convert**: This method is used to convert the value from the source type to a type suitable for the UI. For example, converting a `bool` value to a color or a visibility state.

### 3. ConvertBack Method
```csharp
public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```
- **`public object ConvertBack`**: This is the implementation of the **ConvertBack** method required by the **IValueConverter** interface.
- **Parameters**:
  - **`object value`**: The value being passed from the target property (e.g., from the View to the ViewModel).
  - **`Type targetType`**: The type of the target property in the source, meaning the data type in the ViewModel to which this value needs to be converted.
  - **`object parameter`**: An optional parameter that may influence the conversion logic.
  - **`CultureInfo culture`**: Provides culture-specific information for the conversion.
- **`throw new NotImplementedException();`**: This line of code throws a **NotImplementedException**, indicating that the method hasn't been implemented yet. In many cases, **ConvertBack** might not be needed, so developers may choose to leave it unimplemented if only one-way binding is required.
- **Purpose of ConvertBack**: This method is used to convert the value from the target type (UI) back to the source type (ViewModel). For example, if a user interacts with a control (e.g., a switch that sets a value to true or false), the **ConvertBack** method would convert the updated value back to its original data type.
- 
## Summary
- **BoolConverter** is a custom class that implements **IValueConverter** to provide custom conversion logic for data binding in .NET MAUI applications.
- **Convert Method**: Converts data from the source to the target type, typically used to format data for the UI.
- **ConvertBack Method**: Converts data from the target back to the source type, used in two-way binding scenarios, but can be left unimplemented if not needed.
- **Practical Use**: BoolConverter is commonly used to convert boolean values to colors, visibility states, or other data formats suitable for UI representation.

# ICommand in .NET MAUI

## What is `public ICommand` in .NET MAUI?
In .NET MAUI, **`ICommand`** is an interface that defines an action or command that can be bound to user interface elements, such as buttons. It is commonly used within the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to handle user interactions in a decoupled and reusable way, allowing commands to be defined in the **ViewModel** and triggered from the **View** without directly manipulating the UI from the code-behind.

### Key Features of `ICommand`
- **Command Binding**: Commands allow for easy binding between **UI elements** and **methods** in the **ViewModel**, maintaining separation between UI and business logic.
- **Decoupled Event Handling**: Commands provide a way to handle events from controls (such as a button click) without direct coupling between the view and view logic, promoting **separation of concerns**.
- **Reusable Logic**: A single command can be used for multiple UI elements, promoting reusability.
- **CanExecute and Execute**: The **ICommand** interface provides the ability to determine whether a command can be executed using the **CanExecute** method, and to define the action using the **Execute** method.

## Example of ICommand in .NET MAUI
Below is an example of how to create and use an **ICommand** in .NET MAUI to handle a button click event.

### 1. ViewModel with ICommand Implementation
In the ViewModel, we define the **ICommand** and specify the logic for executing the command.

```csharp
using System.Windows.Input;
using System.ComponentModel;

public class MainViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private string message;
    public string Message
    {
        get => message;
        set
        {
            if (message != value)
            {
                message = value;
                OnPropertyChanged();
            }
        }
    }

    public ICommand ButtonClickCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        ButtonClickCommand = new Command(OnButtonClick);
    }

    private void OnButtonClick()
    {
        Message = "Button clicked!";
    }

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName = null)
    {
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
}
```
- **`ICommand ButtonClickCommand`**: Defines a command named **ButtonClickCommand**.
- **`new Command(OnButtonClick)`**: Creates a new command that runs the **OnButtonClick** method when executed.
- **OnButtonClick**: This method updates the **Message** property, which can be displayed in the UI.
- **INotifyPropertyChanged**: Implemented to notify the UI when the **Message** property changes, allowing the UI to be updated accordingly.

### 2. Using the ICommand in XAML
To use the command in the UI, we bind it to a button's **Command** property.

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="MauiApp.MainPage">
    <ContentPage.BindingContext>
        <local:MainViewModel />
    </ContentPage.BindingContext>

    <StackLayout Padding="20">
        <Button Text="Click Me" Command="{Binding ButtonClickCommand}" />
        <Label Text="{Binding Message}" FontSize="Large" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```
- **BindingContext**: The **BindingContext** of the **ContentPage** is set to the **MainViewModel**, allowing the UI to bind to properties and commands within the ViewModel.
- **Button Command Binding**: The **Button** binds its `Command` property to the **ButtonClickCommand** in the ViewModel. When the button is clicked, it invokes the `OnButtonClick` method.
- **Label Binding**: The **Label** displays the **Message** property, which is updated when the button is clicked.

## Explanation of ICommand Components
| Component          | Description                                                               | Example                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **ICommand**       | Interface defining a command to be bound to UI elements.                  | `public ICommand ButtonClickCommand { get; }` |
| **CanExecute**     | Method to determine whether the command can be executed.                  | `return true;` (default behavior)      |
| **Execute**        | Method defining the action to take when the command is executed.          | `OnButtonClick()`                      |
| **Command Binding**| Binds the command to a UI element, typically in XAML.                     | `Command="{Binding ButtonClickCommand}"` |

## When to Use ICommand
### 1. **Handling Button Clicks and User Actions**
- **Use Case**: When a button click needs to execute logic in the **ViewModel**. Instead of writing code-behind in the **View**, you define commands in the **ViewModel**.
- **Example**: Submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or starting a calculation.

### 2. **Enabling/Disabling UI Elements**
- **Use Case**: When certain actions should only be available based on the application state. The **CanExecute** method can enable or disable UI elements.
- **Example**: Disabling a submit button until all required fields are filled.

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Use Case**: Using **ICommand** helps maintain a clean separation between the UI layer and business logic by moving event handling to the **ViewModel**.
- **Example**: Handling logic for a shopping cart application where buttons for "Add to Cart" and "Remove from Cart" invoke commands in the **ViewModel**, avoiding direct interaction with the UI.

## Summary of ICommand Use Cases
| Scenario                       | Description                                      | Common Use Cases                             |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Button Click Handling**      | Commands to handle user interactions like clicks | Submitting forms, navigation, etc.           |
| **Dynamic UI States**          | Use `CanExecute` to enable/disable elements       | Enabling/disabling buttons based on state    |
| **Separation of Concerns**     | Avoid direct UI manipulation in code-behind      | Keeping business logic in the ViewModel      |

## Practical Scenario
Consider an application with a login button that should only be active when both the username and password fields are filled. Using **ICommand** with a **CanExecute** function allows you to dynamically control the availability of the button based on the state of these fields. This ensures a cleaner, maintainable structure, keeping UI logic within the **ViewModel** and out of the code-behind.

# Comparing `public ICommand` and `private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)` in .NET MAUI

## Overview
In .NET MAUI, there are two primary approaches to handle user interactions, such as button clicks: using **`ICommand`** and the event handler method **`private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)`**. Both serve the purpose of reacting to user input, but they have different characteristics, use cases, and roles in application architecture.

### Key Features of `ICommand`
- **MVVM Integration**: **ICommand** is primarily used in the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to allow UI elements to bind to actions in the **ViewModel**.
- **Command Binding**: Provides a clean way to bind a UI element (e.g., button) to a command in the ViewModel, ensuring separation between the UI and business logic.
- **Decoupling UI and Logic**: Promotes separation of concerns by decoupling UI elements from event-handling code.
- **CanExecute Support**: **ICommand** includes a **CanExecute** method that enables/disables UI elements based on certain conditions.

### Key Features of `private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)`
- **Event Handler in Code-Behind**: This approach uses an event handler directly in the code-behind to manage the action that occurs when a button is clicked.
- **Direct UI Manipulation**: The event handler allows direct interaction with the UI elements, making it suitable for quick prototypes or simple interactions.
- **Tight Coupling**: The logic is embedded in the code-behind file, leading to tighter coupling between the UI and its behavior, which can lead to maintenance challenges as the application grows.

## Example of `ICommand` in .NET MAUI
### ViewModel Command Definition
```csharp
using System.Windows.Input;

public class MainViewModel
{
    public ICommand ButtonClickCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        ButtonClickCommand = new Command(OnButtonClick);
    }

    private void OnButtonClick()
    {
        // Logic to execute when button is clicked
    }
}
```
- **Command Binding**: The **`ButtonClickCommand`** is bound to the button in XAML.
- **Logic in ViewModel**: The action performed is implemented in the **ViewModel** (`OnButtonClick`), promoting separation of concerns.

### XAML Usage
```xml
<Button Text="Click Me" Command="{Binding ButtonClickCommand}" />
```

## Example of `Button_Clicked` in Code-Behind
### Event Handler in Code-Behind
```csharp
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Logic to execute when button is clicked
    }
}
```
- **Direct Binding**: The **`Button_Clicked`** method is used directly in the XAML.

### XAML Usage
```xml
<Button Text="Click Me" Clicked="Button_Clicked" />
```

## Differences Between `ICommand` and `Button_Clicked`
| Feature                     | `public ICommand`                                      | `private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)` |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pattern**                 | Used in **MVVM** to promote separation of concerns     | Event handler used in code-behind                         |
| **Decoupling**              | Decouples UI and business logic                        | Couples UI and logic in the code-behind                   |
| **Binding**                 | Uses **Command** property in XAML                      | Uses **Clicked** event in XAML                            |
| **Reusability**             | Reusable across multiple views                         | Tied to a specific view and UI element                    |
| **Conditional Execution**   | Supports **CanExecute** for enabling/disabling actions | No built-in support for conditions, requires manual logic |
| **Testability**             | Easier to unit test since it is in the ViewModel       | Harder to test as logic is embedded in code-behind        |

## Commonalities
- **User Interaction Handling**: Both approaches handle user interactions, such as button clicks.
- **Triggers UI Actions**: They both allow developers to specify logic that should run when a button is clicked.

## When to Use Each Approach
### 1. **`ICommand` in MVVM Pattern**
- **Use Case**: When following the **MVVM** architecture. It is ideal for larger applications that require **separation of concerns**, **testability**, and **reusability**.
- **Benefits**: Ensures the UI logic is independent of the view, making it easier to test and maintain. Commands can also control whether buttons are enabled/disabled through **CanExecute** logic.

### 2. **`Button_Clicked` Event Handler in Code-Behind**
- **Use Case**: Suitable for smaller projects or rapid prototyping where **MVVM** may add unnecessary complexity.
- **Benefits**: Easy to implement, less boilerplate code, and good for quick, one-off user interactions. However, it leads to tighter coupling between the UI and the logic, making it less ideal for complex or scalable applications.

## Summary
- **`public ICommand`**: Best for maintaining clean separation between UI and logic, used in **MVVM**. Promotes reusability and testability, especially in larger projects.
- **`private void Button_Clicked`**: Quick, straightforward way to handle events in code-behind. Suitable for smaller projects or when rapid development is needed but leads to less maintainable and reusable code.

# Three Ways to Create Commands from the ViewModel in .NET MAUI

## Overview
In .NET MAUI, commands are typically used to bind user actions, like button clicks, to methods defined in the **ViewModel**. This is crucial in the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to maintain a clean separation between UI and business logic. There are three common ways to create commands from the **ViewModel**:

1. **Command Class (`System.Windows.Input.ICommand`)**
2. **RelayCommand**
3. **AsyncCommand**

Each approach has its own strengths and is suited to different scenarios, depending on the requirements for handling user interactions in the application.

### 1. Command Class (`System.Windows.Input.ICommand`)
The **Command** class, provided by **`System.Windows.Input.ICommand`**, is a standard way to create a command in .NET MAUI.

#### Key Features
- **Simple to Implement**: This is a straightforward implementation of the **ICommand** interface, making it easy to use for basic command requirements.
- **Execute and CanExecute Methods**: Provides methods to define the command logic (`Execute`) and determine if it can be executed (`CanExecute`).
- **Usage**: Suitable for most general-purpose commands, where simple logic is needed to handle a user action.

#### Example
```csharp
public class MainViewModel
{
    public ICommand ClickCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        ClickCommand = new Command(OnButtonClicked, CanButtonBeClicked);
    }

    private void OnButtonClicked()
    {
        // Logic for button click
    }

    private bool CanButtonBeClicked()
    {
        // Logic to determine if the button can be clicked
        return true;
    }
}
```
- **`OnButtonClicked`**: Defines the logic to be executed when the button is clicked.
- **`CanButtonBeClicked`**: Controls whether the button is enabled or not.

### 2. RelayCommand
**RelayCommand** is a type of command often used in **MVVM** frameworks like **MVVMLight**. It provides a more flexible way to create commands without needing to implement the **ICommand** interface manually.

#### Key Features
- **Simplified Creation**: Allows quick creation of commands without needing to manually implement **ICommand**.
- **Parameters Support**: Often supports commands with parameters, making it versatile for different types of actions.
- **Usage**: Typically used when there is no need for complex **CanExecute** logic or when parameterized commands are required.

#### Example
```csharp
public class MainViewModel
{
    public RelayCommand ClickCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        ClickCommand = new RelayCommand(OnButtonClicked);
    }

    private void OnButtonClicked()
    {
        // Logic for button click
    }
}
```
- **RelayCommand**: Provides an easier approach to create commands without needing to define **Execute** and **CanExecute** separately.
- **Parameters**: RelayCommand can easily accept parameters, enabling more flexibility.

### 3. AsyncCommand
**AsyncCommand** is used for commands that execute **asynchronous operations**. This is essential for maintaining a responsive UI when performing long-running tasks, such as making network requests or loading data.

#### Key Features
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Commands are executed asynchronously, ensuring that the UI remains responsive.
- **Task-Based Implementation**: The command is usually implemented using **async/await** for proper asynchronous handling.
- **Usage**: Suitable for long-running operations, such as data fetching or updating from a remote server.

#### Example
```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class MainViewModel
{
    public AsyncCommand LoadDataCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        LoadDataCommand = new AsyncCommand(LoadDataAsync);
    }

    private async Task LoadDataAsync()
    {
        // Logic for loading data asynchronously
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate data loading
    }
}
```
- **AsyncCommand**: Executes the **LoadDataAsync** method asynchronously.
- **Responsive UI**: Keeps the UI responsive by running the command asynchronously.

## Comparison of Command Types
| Feature                   | Command (`ICommand`)                          | RelayCommand                           | AsyncCommand                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**        | Implements `ICommand` manually                | Simplified implementation              | Asynchronous command                   |
| **Asynchronous Support**  | No                                           | No                                     | Yes                                    |
| **CanExecute Logic**      | Supports `CanExecute` method                  | Supports `CanExecute` method           | Supports `CanExecute` method           |
| **Parameter Support**     | Limited                                       | Yes                                    | Yes                                    |
| **Use Case**              | General command needs                        | Flexible and quick command creation    | Long-running operations, async logic   |

## Commonalities
- **Command Binding**: All three command types can be bound to UI elements using the **Command** property in XAML.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each command type promotes the separation of UI logic from business logic, maintaining the **MVVM** architecture.

## When to Use Each Command Type
### 1. **Command (`ICommand`)**
- **Use Case**: Best for general-purpose commands that are simple and do not require asynchronous handling.
- **Example**: Toggling a setting on or off.

### 2. **RelayCommand**
- **Use Case**: Ideal when you need a simple, parameterized command. RelayCommand is also useful when you want a quick way to implement commands without much boilerplate.
- **Example**: Submitting a form with input values passed as parameters.

### 3. **AsyncCommand**
- **Use Case**: When dealing with tasks that might take a significant amount of time, like fetching data from a server or processing large amounts of data. AsyncCommand ensures that the UI does not freeze during the operation.
- **Example**: Loading data from a remote database or calling an API.

## Summary
- **Command (`ICommand`)**: Provides a standard implementation of commands suitable for general tasks.
- **RelayCommand**: Offers a simpler and more flexible way to create commands, especially useful for parameterized actions.
- **AsyncCommand**: Designed for asynchronous tasks, keeping the UI responsive during long-running operations.

# SearchButtonPressed, SearchCommand, and SearchCommandParameter in .NET MAUI

## Overview
In **.NET MAUI**, the **SearchBar** control allows users to input search text and initiate searches. This control includes several properties and events to handle user interactions, including **SearchButtonPressed**, **SearchCommand**, and **SearchCommandParameter**. These functionalities help manage how search actions are triggered and processed, making it easier to integrate a search feature in an application.

### Key Elements
1. **SearchButtonPressed**: An event that occurs when the search button is pressed.
2. **SearchCommand**: A command that is executed when the search button is pressed or when a search is initiated.
3. **SearchCommandParameter**: A parameter passed to the **SearchCommand** when it is executed, providing context or additional information to the command.

## 1. SearchButtonPressed
The **SearchButtonPressed** is an **event** in the **SearchBar** control that is triggered when the user presses the search button (typically represented by a magnifying glass icon or an "Enter" key press).

### Key Features
- **Event Handling**: Used to handle the action when the user submits the search input.
- **Code-Behind Implementation**: Often used in code-behind to directly respond to user actions.
- **Flexible Logic**: You can define custom logic, such as validating the search term or updating the UI, in the event handler.

### Example
```csharp
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void SearchBar_SearchButtonPressed(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var searchBar = (SearchBar)sender;
        string searchTerm = searchBar.Text;
        // Logic to handle the search action
        DisplayAlert("Search", $"You searched for: {searchTerm}", "OK");
    }
}
```
- **SearchBar_SearchButtonPressed**: This method is executed when the user presses the search button. It retrieves the search term from the **SearchBar** and displays it in an alert.

### When to Use
- **Simple Search Logic**: Use **SearchButtonPressed** when you want to handle the search logic directly in the code-behind, typically in simpler applications.
- **Event-Based Handling**: Ideal for straightforward scenarios where complex MVVM binding is not needed.

## 2. SearchCommand
The **SearchCommand** is a property of the **SearchBar** control that binds a command from the **ViewModel**. This command is executed whenever a search action is triggered, such as pressing the search button.

### Key Features
- **Command Binding**: Binds to a command in the **ViewModel** to handle the search action, keeping the logic separate from the UI.
- **MVVM Support**: Promotes the **MVVM** pattern by allowing search logic to reside in the **ViewModel**, improving separation of concerns.

### Example
```csharp
public class MainViewModel
{
    public ICommand PerformSearchCommand { get; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        PerformSearchCommand = new Command<string>(OnPerformSearch);
    }

    private void OnPerformSearch(string searchTerm)
    {
        // Logic to perform search
        Console.WriteLine($"Searching for: {searchTerm}");
    }
}
```

```xml
<SearchBar Placeholder="Search here..."
           SearchCommand="{Binding PerformSearchCommand}"
           SearchCommandParameter="{Binding SearchText}" />
```
- **PerformSearchCommand**: Defines a command that handles the search action.
- **Command Binding**: The **SearchCommand** is bound to the **PerformSearchCommand** in the **ViewModel**, which ensures that the search logic is properly separated from the UI.

### When to Use
- **Complex Applications**: Use **SearchCommand** in applications following the **MVVM** pattern to keep the search logic within the **ViewModel**.
- **Reusability**: Suitable when the search command can be reused across multiple views or when you need a centralized approach to handle search actions.

## 3. SearchCommandParameter
The **SearchCommandParameter** is a parameter that is passed to the **SearchCommand** when it is executed. It provides additional information that can be used by the command, such as the current search text.

### Key Features
- **Parameter Passing**: Allows you to pass a value (e.g., the search text) to the command, providing context for the search action.
- **Flexible Context**: Makes it possible to use the same command in different scenarios by varying the parameter.

### Example
```xml
<SearchBar Placeholder="Search here..."
           SearchCommand="{Binding PerformSearchCommand}"
           SearchCommandParameter="{Binding Text, Source={x:Reference searchBar}}" 
           x:Name="searchBar" />
```
- **SearchCommandParameter**: Passes the current text from the **SearchBar** to the **PerformSearchCommand**. This ensures the command has the necessary context to perform the search.

### When to Use
- **Parameter-Specific Logic**: Use **SearchCommandParameter** when the search command logic requires additional context, such as filtering options or user-specific information.
- **Flexible Command Handling**: Ideal when you want the same command to operate differently depending on the context provided by the parameter.

## Summary Table of Search Features
| Feature                 | Description                                                       | Common Use Cases                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **SearchButtonPressed** | Event triggered when the search button is pressed.                | Simple search logic in code-behind.      |
| **SearchCommand**       | Command bound to the **ViewModel** for executing search actions. | MVVM-based applications with separation of concerns. |
| **SearchCommandParameter** | Parameter passed to **SearchCommand** for additional context.   | When search logic requires extra input, such as filter criteria. |

## Commonalities
- **Search Trigger**: All three methods involve triggering a search when a user interacts with the **SearchBar**.
- **User Interaction**: Each method is used to handle user search input in different ways.

## Practical Scenario
Consider an e-commerce application where users can search for products:
- For a **simple search**, **SearchButtonPressed** can be used to quickly handle the search logic in code-behind, making it easy to implement and understand.
- For a **more complex search** that requires filtering based on multiple factors, **SearchCommand** and **SearchCommandParameter** provide flexibility. You can use **SearchCommand** to define a reusable search logic in the **ViewModel**, while **SearchCommandParameter** helps pass different filter options to make the search customizable.
